# win-script-disable-touchpad
This is a Windows 10 batch script for disabling the Synaptics touchpad when a USB mouse is attached. I have found that the mouse preferences checkbox doesn't work as it should. Between PC restarts, the data value changes back to allow the touchpad to be used once again.

This script works up until an update is made on the Synaptics touchpad. This will remove the changes this script adds and will require this script to be run once again.
